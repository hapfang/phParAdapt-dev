SCOREC build system README 


The following is assumed:
- each developer will do their development in a directory given by the
  variable $DEVROOT
- all components of SCOREC software will be installed in a systemwide
  directory set by the variable $DISTROOT

All the code in the system is organized as follows:
$DEVROOT/$SUBSYSNAME/$MODULENAME

where:
  DEVROOT = common root directory of all development software
  SUBSYSNAME = subsystem name that the module belongs to
  MODULENAME = the name of the module

You *must* set DEVROOT before you can do anything. It is suggested
that you set it up in one of your start up files.

Set DISTROOT to a location where the software will be installed (this
isn't really needed if you will just be using the software from the
build directory)

Note 1: It is generaly accepted that DEVROOT will be configured as $HOME/develop
	in fact, the DEVROOT is automatically configured like on SCOREC workstations
	that unless the user explecitely modifies his environment.

Note 2: The DISTROOT is only necessary if the user plans to do a 'make install'.

Note 3: The 'standard' subsystem names currently in use are:
		Util		random utilities modules
		Meshing		modules used to generate/modify meshes
		Applications		End-user standalone applications
		Trellis		Trellis framework modules
		phasta		???
