Version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Preliminary support for F90 modules -cd
* Merged Anil Karanam's changes for F90 modules, alpha_osf and cygwin support. -cd

  script. -cd
* tagged as v1_1_5 6/4/2002 -cd

Version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added the 'FC' variable to config profiles to specify the Fortran compiler. -cd
* Added a configuration for using the Intel compilers under Linux. It is
  called 'x86_linux-icc'. -cd
* Updated make.common to use the $(FC) variable instead of $(F77). -cd
* Made 'doc' a multi-rule target. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_28  9/21/2001 -cd

* Added the 'doc' target that invoques doxygen to generate documentation. By
  default, the make.common will generate a doxygen.config file and call doxygen
  to build LaTeX and HTML documentation, that will be stored in MODULE_ROOT/doc
  directory. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_27 9/12/2001 -cd

* Added a license file. The file contain the current SCOREC open source license.
  The file should NOT be part of any module UNLESS it is desired to make it
  open source. This decision is not to be taken lightly and should be approved
  by the director of SCOREC. -cd
* Updated makefiles to put compiled object file in qualified directories. This
  allows to concurently keep meshSim and non-meshSim version of objects around,
  which is useful for debugging. meshim mode is the default and use C interface
  to be drop-in compatible with other mesh database like AOMD. If the user
  specifies SCOREC_MESH=1, then the C++ interface to the SCOREC Mesh database
  should be used. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_26 9/4/2001 -cd

* Changed some rules (setup, clean) from ':' to '::' to be able to add
  commands to them in module makefile. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_25 8/23/2001 -cd

* Fixed the target check and checkone. They were broken in version 1.0.21 when
  the full path was given when calling gmake recursively. Now doing checks works
  only in the DEVROOT, but users can still compile a module anywhere. -cd
* Fixed sun4_5-gcc libtmpl macro. Failed to link properly as we were not providing
  the right link flag. -cd
* Fixed config files to add system libraries required for mpich2. The libraries
  are specified in the archos-specific config file in MPICH2_SYS_LIBS. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_24 8/16/2001 -cd

* Created config file generic-sunmpi to use the Sun HPC ClusterTools MPI 
  implementation. Instead of mpCC etc, it tries to add itself all the required
  flags. -cd
* Updated generic-mpich2 to add itself all the required flags instead of
  calling mpiCC. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_23 8/14/2001 -cd

* Removed GCC support from config file sun4_5 and sun4_5-64. -cd
* Created config file sun4_5-gcc for using GCC under Solaris. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_22 8/09/2001 -cd

* Modified makefiles so that the module to compile do not have to rest in
  the DEVROOT hierarchy. DEVROOT is used to access dependencies, but the current
  module's files are based on the current directories:
	../bin		executables
	../include	include file links
	../lib		libraries
* tagged as v1_0_21 7/13/2001 -cd

* Updated x86_linux libtmpl for proper linking under Linux. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_20 7/03/2001 -cd

* Removed the '-dalign' from the Sun Workshop configuration as it was dramatically
  increasing the memory usage of some programs (by up to 300% in some cases) for little
  performance gain. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_19 6/26/2001 -cd

* Added support for cygwin environment under Windows. ARCHOS is x86_cygwin. -cd
  (Patch by J-F Remacle) At this time, cygwin doesn't produce shared 
  libraries.
* Cleaned-up a bit various config file. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_18 4/24/2001 -cd

* Updated make.common to not pre-qualify libraries in the check and checkone rules.
  The prequalification when testing in optimized mode caused double-qualification
  for the tested library (as in afHeatTransfer-O-O ). -cd
* tagged as v1_0_17 4/10/2001 -cd

* Updated README files. -cd
* Things to document:
	Makefile.include
	ARCHOS
	INCLUDES
	DEPS
	LDFLAGS
	OUTNAME
	dirs
	ISEXECUTABLE
	NOSHARED
	QUIET
	NODEP
	ADDLIB
	FQLIBS
	LIBS
	make targets check / checkone
* Updated config/sun4_5 and config/sun4_5-64 to build proper static 
  libraries. -cd
* Updated config/sgi_6 and config/sgi_6-64 to build proper static 
  libraries. -cd
* Updated make.common so that you can specify NOSHARED=1 when building an 
  application to force linking statically with SCOREC libraries. This is an
  all-or-nothing option, it bypasses the standard linker algorithm by 
  fully specifying the library filenames. It also requires perl as 
  /usr/local/bin/perl. If it is located elsewhere, update the first line
  of static.pl -cd
* tagged as v1_0_16  01/25/2001 -cd

* Added config generic-mpich2 for mpich version 1.2.1 installed in 
  /usr/local/mpich/1.2.1/MPICOMM -cd
* Note that by default the C++ bindings for MPI are not included. -cd
* Fixed obscure in make.common when updating dependency files could cause
  problems when two files had similar names: a dot wasn't escaped in the sed
  regex. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_15  10/18/2000 -cd

* Now we can purify a ISEXECUTABLE module by defining PURIFY=1 -cd
* Ported fix to sgi_6-64 (see below) -cd
* Fixed a bug in sgi_6 where the standard lib wasn't used if
  ISEXECUTABLE was set to 1 (missing LANG:std flag) -ok
* tagged as v1_0_14   10/09/2000 -ok

* Added a $(SED) at the end of the linking phase of executable for MAGI. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_13 9/25/2000 -cd

* Removed '+w' from FFLAGS on Sun. -cd
* Added a call to getarch at the beginning of make.common so that we can
  use that information in Makefile.include files. -cd
* Added xarch flag to sun4_5-64 configuration file. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_12  9/08/2000 -cd

* Removed occurences of hard-coded 'sun4_5' in make.common, and replaced with
  ARCHOS. Caused problem in the creation of auto-dependency files. -cd
* Changes to config files to support executable module compilation. -cd
* Updated make.common to include 'Makefile.include' before make.initial to be
  able to specify things there like the PARALLEL variable for test cases. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_11  9/06/2000 -cd

* Added flag '-ptused' for the SGI C++ compiler to fix an error with 
  template instantiation. (from Ottmar Klaas) -cd
* Changed link command from 'ld' to 'CC' on sgi_6* to fix .init section
  of .so files. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_10  8/31/2000 -cd

* make.TrellisModules is not needed anymore. Removed it from this
  version of buildUtil -ok
* tagged as v1_0_9  8/30/2000 -ok

* Changed link command from 'ld' to 'CC' on sun4_5 to fix .init section
  of .so files. -cd
* The above may cause us to no longer need to link with the obj files in
  SunWS_cache dir. This needs to be tested. -cd
* Added a flag PURIFY=1 which will cause all generated executables to be 
  purify instrumented. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_8 8/30/2000 -cd

* Fixed error on Sun when the module didn't have any template and Make
  would try to link with unexisting files in SunWS_cache. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_7 8/24/2000 -cd

* Fixed a typo in make.initial causing BUILDSYS to not be defined. -cd
* Moved the following ARCHOS configuration to obsolete directory:
    sgi_mips4 sun4_4 sun4H_5 
  also created a configuration for Sun SPARC V9 64 bit as sun4_5-64  -cd
* Modified qualification of libraries. Now the libraries specified in the LIBS
  are only expanded for the OPT QUAL. The user must add the '-mpich' and 
  other DBQUAL where needed. -cd
* If a module defines FQLIBS, and LIBS is not used at all and FQLIBS is used 
  instead WITH NO QUAL EXPANSION AT ALL. -cd
* Added FFLAGS to standard configs for Fortran optimization/debugging. -cd
* Modified order of CFLAGS & al to allow user to override standard settings. -cd
* tagged as v1_0_6 8/21/2000 -cd

* Made 'checkone' more verbose, and 'check' less so. -cd
* Moved around LDFLAGS for when we link with static 3rd party libs. -cd
* Was not linking with libraries with the same qualification
  (PQUAL, DBQUAL, QUAL) triple. Fixed.  -cd
* tagged as v1_0_5  8/17/2000 -cd

* Added 'checkone' target to check only one test case. -cd
* Fixed dependencies on 'check' targets. -cd
* Tagged as v1_0_4 8/17/2000 -cd

* Forgot to add DEFS to C dependency generator. -cd
* Make testdirs name configurable. -cd
* No longer 'sort -u' dependencies because under Linux they are reordered,
  cause syntax errors. -cd
* Tagged as v1_0_3  8/16/2000 -cd

* Fixed config/x86_linux to make depend files less verbose. -cd
* Fixed make.common to prevent error under Linux. -cd
* SGI now defaults to n32 binary interface. sgi_6-n32 config file remove. -cd
* SGI now also defaults to mips3 instruction set, compatible with the
  MIPS R4000 and up CPUs. This makes some advanced instructions available. -cd
* make.common now read a file named 'Makefile.include' in the current
  directory and takes it into account. It can be used to add
  defines, libraries, flags, etc specific to a test case. -cd
* Updated config file for sgi_6-64 ARCHOS. -cd
* module-specific Makefile can now have at setup target too for
  module-specific setup tasks such as set up of test cases. -cd
* Tagged as v1_0_2  8/15/2000 -cd

* Added README.testing and README.GNU documents. -cd
* Updated make.common, make testing less verbose. -cd
* Changed the way test binaires are cleaned up. Keep the binaries around
  in case we want to run them by hand. -cd
* Library failed to make on Sun with C-only module. -cd
* Tagged as v1_0_1  8/14/2000 -cd

* Updated and spell-checked the documentation. -cd
* Updated the building process to make it more intelligent. -cd
* Adapted the 0.4 process to make it applicable even to executable modules,
  not just library modules. -cd
* Try to build shared libraries for all platforms instead of just for Sun. -cd


version 0.4
___________
* Fixed a bug that prevented fortran files that end on .F to compile
* Tagges as v0_4_4  8/7/2000 -ok

* Fixed a typo in the make.TrellisModules file
* Eliminated -lmodel from the MESHLIB variable
* Tagged as v0_4_3  8/02/2000 -ok

* Added the following targets: 
	sgi_mips4: uses n32 format, mips4 architecture with R10000 CPU target.
		   Required for Pro/Engineer 2000i sgi_mips4 target.
	x86_linux: Linux running on Intel with gcc/g++ with i686 optimization
* Updated 'getarch' to define the new Linux target. The new SGI target is never
  selected automatically, it's too special purpose.
* Tagged as v0_4_2  8/01/2000 -cd

* added support to compile a library that connects to Oracle database.
  Basically the gmake utility now understands DATABASE=something
  as an argument. That something can be OTL_ODBC, OTL_ORA7, OTL_ORA8
  at the current time. -ok
* tagged as v0_4_1  6/12/2000 -ok

* sgi_6 has been moved to sgi_6-o32, sgi_6-n32 is now sgi_6. The reason
  for this is that SGI doesn't recommend to use the o32 version anymore.
  The highly recommend to use n32 or n64.
* Both, the n32 and the n64 version have gotten the flag -LANG:std to 
  acctivate the full namespace std according to the C++ standard
* Both, the n32 and the n64 version recognice the typename keyword now
  so that the corresponding define variable was eliminated
* buildutil builds now shared libraries as a default. Non shared libraries
  can be built using the NOSHARED=1 option
* Changes were made to acknowledge the fact that Sun changed the strategy
  on template handling. The old Template.DB repository doesn't exist anymore.
  It's now called SunWS_cache (and behaves a bit different)
* .o files are now kept around. Due to the fact that the Sun compiler 5.0 is
  about a factor of 5 slower then the 4.2 version it seems to be reasonable
  to sacrifice space for the time.
* buildutil can now compile files ending with .f and .F
* buildUtil recognizes the keyword QUIET. If it is set the output stream
  will be written to out.compile, and the errors will be written to error.compile.
  e.g. : gmake executable QUIET=1
* a new module make.TrellisModules predefines plenty of variables that should
  get rid of a lot of clutter in the makefiles. See e.g. heatTrans/test/1/Makefile
